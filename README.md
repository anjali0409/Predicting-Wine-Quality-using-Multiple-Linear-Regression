# Predicting-Wine-Quality-using-Multiple-Linear-Regression
* Portugal is top down wine exporting country and we know that divine accounts for 15 percent of the total

  Portuguese production to support growth.

* The wine industry is investing in new technologies for both winemaking and selling process and wine

  certification and quality assessment are the key element within this context.

* Certification prevents the illegal activities of wines and assures quality of the wine and the market.

  So basically we are going to have some data that is collected from May of 2004 to February of 2007 using

  only protected designation of origin samples that were tested at the official certification entity which

  is CVRVV.

* The data were recorded by a computerized system lab which automatically manages the process of wine

  samples testing from producer requests to laboratory and sensory analysis. 

* Due to privacy issues and logitic issues, only physicochemical and sensory variables are available.

* For example there is no data about grape types, wine brand and wine selling price.

* The two training data sets are available:

  -Red wine(1,599 samples).
  -White wine(4,898 samples).

* Wine quality dataset :

  - Input variables(based on phsicochemical tests):

         Fixed acididty, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulphur dioxide, 
         total sulphur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol
  
  - Output variable(based on sensory data):
     
        Quality, with a score between 0 and 10
